Mineralized collagen induces phenotypic changes in MDA-MB-231\\n(Submitter supplied) We examine the transcriptional alterations induced by in vitro culture of MDA-MB-231 cells on microfabricated hydroxyapatite-mineralized collagen devices that simulate bone matrix (PMID 29759731). As a control, we additionally characterize the transcriptional activity of cells cultured on a collagen substrate. We find that mineralized collagen increases the expression of genes associated with stemness and metastasis while culture on collagen increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression.\\nOrganism:\\tHomo sapiens\\nType:\\t\\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nPlatform: GPL18573 8 Samples\\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE229nnn/GSE229094/\\nSeries\\t\\tAccession: GSE229094\\tID: 200229094',\n",

       " 'Ridaforolimus (MK-8669) synergizes with Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in hormone-sensitive breast cancer\\n(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) represents a key downstream intermediate for a myriad of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option.   Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; “MK-0646”; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; “MK-8669”; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (“LET”, aromatase inhibitor).   Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach.   Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors.\\nOrganism:\\tHomo sapiens\\nType:\\t\\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nPlatform: GPL11154 46 Samples\\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE79nnn/GSE79492/\\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA315980\\nSeries\\t\\tAccession: GSE79492\\tID: 200079492',\n",

Traditionally, studies on metastasis have focused on proteins and protein-coding genes, but recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have achieved increasing interest. miRNAs involved in the metastatic process are poorly defined, and while the use of clinical tissue samples or in vitro assessment for study of the first phases of the metastatic process is not feasible; such processes may be studies using in vivo models created by inoculation of human cell lines into mice. more...\\nOrganism:\\tHomo sapiens\\nType:\\t\\tNon-coding RNA profiling by array\\nPlatform: GPL15462 16 Samples\\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE37nnn/GSE37719/\\nSeries\\t\\tAccession: GSE37719\\tID: 200037719',\n",

Studies of the regulation of the expression of many of these genes by oxygen has implicated a role for the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).

As a control, we additionally characterize the transcriptional activity of cells cultured on a collagen substrate. We find that mineralized collagen increases the expression of genes associated with stemness and metastasis while culture on collagen increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression.\n",
