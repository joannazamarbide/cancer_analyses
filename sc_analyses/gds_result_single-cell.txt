(Submitter supplied) We examine the transcriptional alterations induced by in vitro culture of MDA-MB-231 cells on microfabricated hydroxyapatite-mineralized collagen devices that simulate bone matrix (PMID 29759731). As a control, we additionally characterize the transcriptional activity of cells cultured on a collagen substrate. We find that mineralized collagen increases the expression of genes associated with stemness and metastasis while culture on collagen increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression.

2. Evaluation of breast cancer PDX tumor heterogeneity at single cell resolution [scRNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. PDXs (patient-derived xenografts) are similar to cancer cell lines but differ in that they are maintained in a physiological setting as soon as they are isolated from the patient and for subsequent passages. These models are valuable for preclinical trials because PDX models have been shown to closely match their patient counterparts, both in genomic profile and response to treatment. more...

4. Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals tumor-intrinsic responses to radiotherapy
(Submitter supplied) Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most commonly used anti-cancer therapies. However, the landscape of cellular response to irradiation, especially to a single high-dose irradiation, remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR loss-of-function screen and revealed temporal inherent and acquired responses to RT. Specifically, we found that loss of the IL1R1 pathway led to cellular resistance to RT. more...

10. Engineering Pluripotent DNA Methylation by CpG Island Methylation Response (CIMR) to Synthetic CpG-free ssDNA Insertion
(Submitter supplied) Integration of synthetic CpG Free DNA induces de novo DNAme in the flanking CpG island. Cellular differentiation requires global changes to DNA methylation (DNAme), where it functions  to regulate transcription factor and chromatin remodeling activity, and genome interpretation.  Here, we describe a simple DNAme engineering approach in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs),  extending across large stretches of CpG dense “islands (CGIs).” Integration of synthetic CpG free  single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) induces a target CpG Island Methylation Response (CIMR) in  multiple PSC lines, Nt2d1 embryonal carcinoma cells, and mouse PSCs, but not in highly  methylated CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) positive cancer lines. more...

Here, we used single-cell magneto-optical capture (scMOCa) to isolate fast cells from heterogeneous breast cancer cell populations, based on their migratory ability alone. We show that captured fast cell subpopulations retain higher migration speed and focal adhesion dynamics over many generations due to a motility-related transcriptomic profile. more...

(Submitter supplied) Aberrant activation of the forkhead protein FOXA1 is observed in advanced hormone-related cancers. However, to date, key mediators of high FOXA1 signaling remain elusive. We demonstrate that ectopic high FOXA1 (H-FOXA1) expression promotes estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, H-FOXA1 reprograms ER-chromatin binding to elicit a core gene signature (CGS) highly enriched in ER+ endocrine-resistant (EndoR) cells. more...

69. MicroRNA-874 targets phosphomevalonate kinase and inhibits cancer cell growth via the mevalonate pathway [scRNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The microRNA (miR) miR-874, a potential tumour suppressor, causes cell death via target gene suppression in various cancer types. Mevalonate pathway inhibition also causes cell death in breast cancer. However, the relationship between the mevalonate pathway and miR-874-induced apoptosis or its association with the tumour suppressor p53 has not been elucidated. We identified phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK), a key mevalonate pathway enzyme, and sterol regulatory element-binding factor 2 (SREBF2), the master cholesterol biosynthesis regulator, as direct miR‑874 targets. more...

84. Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Molecular Features in Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a nonobligate precursor of invasive breast cancer. Its biological features, particularly its intratumoral heterogeneity, remain obscure. Moreover, mechanism of lymph node metastasis is unclear. To address this deficiency, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of DCIS, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and lymph node metastasis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that breast cancer exhibits intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional level, defining specific functions, and that DCIS has similar heterogeneity to IDC.

PARPis also demonstrate activity in non-BRCA mutated tumors presumably through induction of PARP1-DNA trapping. Despite pronounced clinical response, therapeutic resistance to PARPis inevitably develops.

102. Single-cell analysis reveals inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in metastatic breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) The plasticity and heterogeneity of cancer cells are known to play a major role in malignant progression, yet the precise molecular drivers of metastases remain elusive. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on tumours and matched lung macrometastases of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of breast cancer to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis during colonization.

104. Rad21 is the core subunit of cohesin complex in directing genome organization
(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotes, the nuclear chromatin in the interphase is a hierarchical organization. Previous studies have suggested that cohesin-DNA interactions play important architectural functions for chromatin structure in the interphase. In this study, we applied super-resolution imaging, single-molecule imaging to measure the distribution of cohesin subunits. Hi-C and RNA-seq were used to reveal the 3D genome structures alterations and the relationship with breast cancer upon Rad21 up-regulation. more...

110. The metastatic spread of breast cancer accelerates during sleep
(Submitter supplied) The metastatic spread of cancer is achieved by the haematogenous dissemination of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Generally, however, the temporal dynamics that dictate the generation of metastasis-competent CTCs are largely uncharacterized, and it is often assumed that CTCs are constantly shed from growing tumours or are shed as a consequence of mechanical insults1. Here we observe a striking and unexpected pattern of CTC generation dynamics in both patients with breast cancer and mouse models, highlighting that most spontaneous CTC intravasation events occur during sleep. more...

(Submitter supplied) While estrogen receptor positive breast tumors generally respond well to endocrine therapy (ET), up to 40% of patients will experience relapse, either while on endocrine therapy or after ET is completed. We have previously shown that the selective pressure of tamoxifen activates the pro-survival NFkB pathway in patient tumors, breast cancer cell lines, and breast cancer xenograft tumors, and that this activation allows for survival of a population of ET-tolerant cells, which can contribute to relapse after ET withdrawal. more...

168. Pre-neoplastic stromal cells drive BRCA1-mediated breast tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) Women with germline mtuation in BRCA1 have increased risk for developing hereditary breast cancer. The role of the epitheilum-assocaited niche during BRCA1-driven tumor intiation remains unclear. Here, we show that the pre-malignant stromal niche promotes epithelial prolifeation and BRCA1-driven cancer intiation in trans. Using single-cell RNA seq analysis of human pre-neoplastic BRCA1 and control breast tissue, we show that stromal cells provide numerous pro-proliferative paracrine signals inducing epithelial proliferation.

202. RB-loss determines selective resistance and novel vulnerabilities in breast cancer modelsRB loss
(Submitter supplied) The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB1) plays a critical role in coordinating multiple pathways that impact on tumor initiation, disease progression, and therapeutic responses.   Here we interrogated the effect of CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with mTOR inhibtor. Also, we interrogtaed the efffect of AURK and WEE1 inhibition in ER+ breast cacner models While the RB-pathway has been purported to exhibit multiple mutually exclusive events, only RB1 is mutually exclusive with multiple genetic events that deregulate CDK4/6 activity. more...

218. TDRD3 promotes DHX9 chromatin recruitment and R-loop resolution
(Submitter supplied) R-loops, which consist of a DNA/RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of chromatin biology. R-loops are particularly enriched at gene promoters, where they play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that control promoter-associated R-loops remain unclear. The epigenetic “reader” Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3), which recognizes methylarginine marks on histones and on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, was previously shown to recruit DNA topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) to relax negatively supercoiled DNA and prevent R-loop formation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Splicing is a central RNA-based process commonly altered in human cancers; however, how the splicing machinery is co-opted during tumorigenesis remains largely unresolved. Here we identify the splice factor SF3A3 at the nexus of an oncogenic translation program that rewires splicing to promote tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that key spliceosomal networks centered on the essential core U2-associated factor, SF3A3, are exquisitely controlled at the translation level during oncogenic stress. more...

267. Phenotypically supervised single cell sequencing parses within-cell-type heterogeneity
(Submitter supplied) We used a phenotypic cell sorting technique to ask whether phenotypically supervised scRNAseq analysis (pheno-scRNAseq) can provide more insight into heterogeneous cell behaviors than unsupervised scRNAseq. Using a simple 3D in vitro breast cancer (BRCA) model, we conducted pheno-scRNAseq on invasive and non-invasive cells and compared the results to phenotype-agnostic scRNAseq analysis. Pheno-scRNAseq identified unique and more selective differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than unsupervised scRNAseq analysis. more...

278. Hypoxia Triggers the Intravasation of Clustered Circulating Tumor Cells
(Submitter supplied) Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from solid cancers in the form of single or clustered cells, with the latter displaying an extraordinary ability to initiate metastasis. Yet, the biological phenomena that trigger the intravasation of CTC clusters are largely unknown. Here, we compare gene expression of hypoxic and normoxic CTC clusters to identify genes that are not only upregulated as a consequence to hypoxia, but that may also play a pivotal role in promoting CTC clusters generation and metastasis.

284. Paracrine Ras/ERK signalling drives gene expression plasticity in a model of basal-like breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) The EGFR/Ras/ERK signalling pathway is a primary driver of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in tumours that exhibit high cell-to-cell heterogeneity. While the signalling activity of this pathway is frequently amplified in tumours, it is not understood how the kinetic aspects of its activation in tumours differ from normal cellular signalling. We explored these single-cell kinetic differences using live-cell reporters of ERK signalling in the breast cancer progression series HMT-3522 and found that ERK activity in invasive cells is similar in amplitude to non-malignant cells but is highly dynamic and more disordered, leading to more heterogeneous expression of ERK target genes. more...

298. Landscape of G-quadruplex DNA structural regions in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Response and resistance to anticancer therapies vary due to inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Here, we developed and applied a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing methodology to map differentially enriched G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structure-forming regions (∆G4Rs) in 22 breast cancer patient-derived tumour xenograft (PDTX) models. ∆G4Rs are significantly more associated with the promoter of highly amplified and expressed genes, and with somatic single-nucleotide variant mutations. more...

299. Estrogen induces dynamic ERa and RING1B recruitment to control gene and enhancer activities in luminal breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) We have previously shown that RING1B, a core Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 subunit, is amplified in 22% of breast cancer patients. In ER+ breast cancer, RING1B functionally interacts and co-localizes with ERa at enhancers and actively transcibed genes to modulate oncogenic transcriptional programs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in ER+ breast cancer cells, prolonged estrogen (E2) administration induces fluctuations in transcriptional output and chromatin landscape. more...

300. DNA structure-specific endonuclease FEN1 as a novel drug target in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a key transcriptional regulator in the majority of breast cancers. ERα-positive patients are frequently treated with tamoxifen, but resistance is common. In this study, we refined a previously identified 111-gene outcome prediction-classifier, revealing FEN1 as the strongest determining factor in ERα-positive patient prognostication. FEN1 levels were predictive of outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients, and FEN1 played a causal role in ERα-driven cell growth. more...

301. Memory sequencing reveals heritable single cell gene expression programs associated with distinct cellular behaviors
(Submitter supplied) Non-genetic factors can cause individual cells to fluctuate substantially in gene expression levels over time. Yet it remains unclear whether these fluctuations can persist for much longer than the time of one cell division. Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the duration of gene expression fluctuations or cellular memory difficult to measure. more...

In addition, both signaling pathways fulfill important roles in cancer initiation and progression. The inherent complexity of the INSR/IGF1R pathways, along with the well documented cross-talk between insulin-like ligands and receptors, translated into a disappointingly slow pace in the development of INSR/IGF1R-directed therapies in oncology. more...

330. Single-cell RNA-seq of B cell polustion in breast cancer patients
(Submitter supplied) Re-education of immune cells in tumor microenvironment is required for optimal treatment outcome. The prevailing notion is that B cells, a major immune cell type in tumors, are immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral. However, why B cells inhibit tumor progression in certain contexts remains unexplained. By single cell dissection of B cell heterogeneity in longitudinal samples of breast cancer patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we revealed a distinct subset of B cells emerges after chemotherapy, which is predictive for therapeutic efficacy and prognosis in multiple patient cohorts. more...

331. Pan-cancer molecular analysis of the RB-pathway
(Submitter supplied) The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB1) plays a critical role in coordinating multiple pathways that impact on tumor initiation, disease progression, and therapeutic responses.   Here we interrogated the TCGA pan-cancer data collection to probe fundamental molecular features associated with the RB-pathway across 31 tumor-types. While the RB-pathway has been purported to exhibit multiple mutually exclusive events, only RB1 is mutually exclusive with multiple genetic events that deregulate CDK4/6 activity. more...

332. Transcriptional diversity and bioenergetic shift in human breast cancer metastasis revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Although metastasis remains the cause of most cancer-related mortality, mechanisms governing seeding in distal tissues are poorly understood. Here we establish a robust method for identification of global transcriptomic changes in rare metastatic cells during seeding using single-cell RNA-sequencing and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer. We find that both primary tumours and micrometastases display transcriptional heterogeneity, but micrometastases harbor a distinct transcriptome program conserved across PDX models that is highly predictive of poor survival in patients. more...

(Submitter supplied) To understand how chronic cadmium exposure alters the dependency of ERα in terms of gene expression, we transiently silenced ERα using ICI, an antiestrogen that promotes the degradation of ERα. MCF7 and cadmium-adapted cells (Cd7 and Cd12) were treated with ICI to mediate the degradation of ERα, and a nonbiased global gene expression analysis was conducted using RNA-seq.  MCF7 shared 67.3% and 59.5% of the DE genes with Cd7 and Cd12 cells, respectively, suggesting that ERα continues to play an important role in regulating the expression of genes following chronic cadmium exposure. more...

(Submitter supplied) Steroid hormones are key gene regulators in breast cancer cells. While estrogens stimulate cell proliferation, progestins activate a single cell cycle followed by proliferation arrest. Here, we use biochemical and genome wide approaches to show that progestins achieve this effect via a functional crosstalk with C/EBPα. Using ChIP-seq, we identify around 1,000 sites where C/EBPα binding precedes and helps binding of Progesterone Receptor (PR) in response to hormone. more...

362. Single-cell Transcriptomics reveals multi-step adaptations to endocrine therapy
(Submitter supplied) Resistant tumours are thought to arise from the action of Darwinian selection on intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. However, clonal selection is incompatible with the late recurrence often characterising luminal breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy (ET), suggesting a more complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors. In the present study, we dissect the contributions of clonal genetic diversity and transcriptional plasticity during the early and late phases of ET at single-cell resolution. more...

365. On-Treatment Biomarkers Improve Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is increasingly being used to preoperatively shrink breast tumours prior to surgery. This approach also provides the opportunity to study the molecular changes associated with treatment and evaluate whether on-treatment sequential samples can improve response and outcome predictions over diagnostic or excision samples alone. Methods: A total of 95 samples from a cohort of 50 neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated primary breast cancer patients (aged 29-76, 48% ER+, 20% HER2+) enrolled in the NEO trial taken before, at 2 weeks on-treatment, mid-therapy and at resection were sequenced with Ion Ampliseq transcriptome yielding expression values for 12,635 genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cancer is a rapidly evolving, multifactorial disease that accumulates numerous genetic alterations. This results in phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity within the tumor, the complexity of which is further amplified through specific interactions between cancer cells. We aimed at dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperation between different clones. We produced clonal cell lines derived from the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, using the UbC-StarTrack system, which allows tracking of multiple clones by colour: GFP C3, mKO E10 and Sapphire D7. more...

371. Drug combination of 17-AAG and Belinostat on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most common cancer that threatens women's health. While the strategy of drug combination can help to reduce adverse effects and to overcome the resistance of clinical treatment of single drug. In this work, we report the synergetic effect between a HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG and a HDAC inhibitor Belinostat, on the triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The RNA-Seq data analysis showed that the most over-represented KEGG pathways in the combination group came from migration or invasion related genes, which were not observed in the differentially expressed genes after the treatment of 17-AAG or Belinostat alone.

376. Acquisition of a hybrid E/M state is essential for tumorigenicity of basal breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Using the recently described CD104+/CD44hi antigen combination we demonstrate that tumorigenicity depends on individual cells residing in a hybrid E/M state. Acquisition of this E/M hybrid state is facilitated by the differential expression of EMT- TFs, like Snail accompanied by the expression of adult stem-cell programs. Transition from the highly tumorigenic E/M state to a fully mesenchymal phenotype, achieved by constitutive ectopic expression of Zeb1, is sufficient to drive cells out of the E/M hybrid state into an extreme mesenchymal (xM) state, which is accompanied by a substantial loss of tumorigenicity and a switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signaling.

379. Comparison of Mature Megakaryocytes Differentiated by TPO or Small Molecule TPO Mimetics
(Submitter supplied) TPO mimetics have been shown to activate TPO receptor, the downstream JAK-STAT pathway, and induce differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into megakaryocytes.  However, the action of these TPO mimetics is initiated by binding to the transmembrane domain of the TPO receptor, which is distinct from the binding site of the native ligand, TPO.  To determine whether TPO mimetics can differentiate hematopoietic stem cells into the same megakaryocytes as native TPO does, we performed a microarray experiment to compare the globe gene expression in purified CD61+ cells derived from TPO or TPO mimetic treated CD34+ bone marrow cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) The ability of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to form clusters has been linked to increased metastatic potential. Yet biological features and vulnerabilities of CTC clusters remain largely unknown. Our DNA methylation analysis led us to hypothesize that CTC clusters are characterized by active TF networks that support both stemness and proliferation. To identify whether the stemness- and proliferation-related TF networks are also transcriptionally active in CTC clusters compared to single CTCs, we performed single-cell resolution RNA sequencing analysis of single CTCs and CTC clusters, matched within individual liquid biopsies and isolated from six breast cancer patients with progressive metastatic disease, and of single CTCs and CTC clusters isolated from three xenograft models. more...

(Submitter supplied) The cell type composition of many biological tissues varies widely across samples. Such sample heterogeneity hampers efforts to probe the role of each cell type in the tissue microenvironment. Current approaches that address this issue have drawbacks. Cell sorting or single-cell based experimental techniques disrupt in situ interactions and alter physiological status of cells in tissues. Computational methods are flexible and promising; but they often estimate either sample-specific proportions of each cell type or cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, not both, by requiring the other as input. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered responsible for cancer relapse and drug-resistance. Understanding the identity of BCSCs may open new avenues in breast cancer therapy. Although several discoveries have been made on BCSCs characterization, the factors critical to BCSCs is largely unclear. This study was aimed to determine whether genomic mutation contributes to the acquisition of cancer stem-like phenotype, and to investigate the genetic and transcriptional features of BCSCs. more...

402. Development and Characterisation of Acquired Radioresistant Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Radiotherapy plays an important role in the multimodal treatment of breast cancer. The response of a breast tumour to radiation depends not only on its innate radiosensitivity but also on tumour repopulation by cells that have developed radioresistance. Development of effective cancer treatments will require further molecular dissection of the processes that contribute to resistance.  Methods: Radioresistant cell lines were established by exposing MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and ZR-751 parental cells to increasing weekly doses of radiation. more...

411. Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries
(Submitter supplied) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To generate more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. more...

428. DNA methylation analysis of breast cancer Hs578T cells with TET1 knockout
(Submitter supplied) Both gains and losses of DNA methylation are common in cancer but the factors controlling this methylation balance remain unclear. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype that does not overexpress hormone receptors or HER2/NEU is one of the most hypomethylated cancers observed. In search for an explanation for this, we discovered that the TET1 DNA demethylase is specifically overexpressed in about 40% of patients with TNBC, where it is associated with hypomethylation of up to 10% of queried CpG sites and a worse overall survival. more...

436. LSD1 ablation stimulates anti-tumor immunity and enables checkpoint blockade
(Submitter supplied) Chromatin regulators play a broad role in regulating gene expression, and when gone awry, can lead to cancer. Here we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs, and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to dsRNA stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. more...

460. Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response
(Submitter supplied) Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, and it results from ongoing errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. While CIN is a major driver of tumor evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that CIN promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumor-cell autonomous inflammatory response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose envelopes frequently rupture exposing their DNA content to the cytosol. more...

461. Comparison of GATA3 mutant and GATA3 wild type isogenic MCF-7 and CAMA1 breast cancer cell lines
(Submitter supplied) The GATA3 transcription factor is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer. Heterozygous mutations, largely frameshifting, are seen in 15% of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, the subtype in which these mutations are almost exclusively found. Mouse studies have shown that Gata3 is critical for breast development and that GATA3 gene dosage affects breast tumor progression. Human patient data have shown that high Gata3 expression, a feature of luminal subtype breast cancers, is associated with a better prognosis. more...

462. Gene expression profiling in response to radiation treatment in breast cancer [patient samples]
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Breast radiotherapy is currently “one size fits all” regardless of breast cancer subtype (eg. luminal, basal). However, recent clinical data suggests that radiation response may vary significantly among subtypes.  Therefore, current practice leads to over- or under-treatment of women whose tumors are more or less radiation responsive.  We hypothesized that this clinical variability may be due, in part, to differences in cellular radiation response. more...

464. Recruitment of the EMSY/KDM5A/SIN3B complex to target genes is regulated by ZNF131
(Submitter supplied) Recent work from others and us revealed interactions between the Sin3/HDAC complex, the H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5A, GATAD1 and EMSY. Here, we characterize the EMSY/KDM5A/SIN3B complex in detail by quantitative interaction proteomics and ChIP-sequencing. We identify a novel substoichiometric interactor of the complex, ZNF131, which recruits EMSY to a large number of active, H3K4me3 marked promoters. Interestingly, using an EMSY knock-out line and subsequent rescue experiments, we show that EMSY is in most cases positively correlated with transcriptional activity of its target genes and stimulates cell proliferation. more...

BRCA1 is best known for its functions in DNA repair and resolution of DNA replication stress. However, it is unclear whether loss of these ubiquitously important functions of BRCA1 fully explains the cell lineage-specific increase in breast tumor development. Cell culture-based studies implicate BRCA1 in elimination of R-loops, DNA-RNA hybrid structures involved in transcriptional regulation and genetic instability. more...

Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that it failed to account for possible crosstalk between EMT and non-EMT cells that promotes dissemination of non-EMT cells. In breast cancer models, EMT cells induce increased metastasis of weakly metastatic, non-EMT tumor cells in a paracrine manner in part by non-cell autonomous activation of the GLI transcription factor. more...

(Submitter supplied) A long noncoding RNA (Lnc-BM) mediates JAK2 activity in 231-BM cells treated with OSM. Emerging evidence has shown that the effect of JAK2 is mainly mediated by three downstream signaling pathways including the AKT, MAPK, and STAT1/3/5 pathways. To determine the signaling pathways that are regulated by Lnc-BM, we performed gene expression microarray analysis on cells with Lnc-BM depletion or JAK2 KO and compared them to their corresponding controls following OSM stimulation.

(Submitter supplied) Hormone therapy targeting estrogen receptor (ER) is the principal treatment for ER-positive breast cancers but many cancers develop resistance to anti-estrogens. Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a transcriptional regulator of several oncogenic pathways. Expression levels of CDK8 and ERα are inversely correlated in breast cancers suggesting a functional association between CDK8 and ER. CDK8 inhibition by selective small-molecule inhibitors, by shRNA knockdown or by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout suppressed estrogen-induced transcription, with no significant effects on ERα protein expression or phosphorylation. more...

494. Evidence of two distinct functionally specialized fibroblast lineages in breast stroma
(Submitter supplied) Background: The terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) is the most dynamic structure in the human breast and the putative site of origin of human breast cancer. Although stromal cells contribute to a specialized microenvironment in many organs, this component remains largely understudied in the human breast. We here demonstrate the impact on epithelium of two lineages of breast stromal fibroblasts, one of which accumulates in the TDLU while the other resides outside the TDLU in the interlobular stroma. more...

(Submitter supplied) Dietary energy restriction (DER) reduces risk of spontaneous mammary cancer in rodents. In humans, DER in premenopausal years seems to reduce risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Markers of DER are required to develop acceptable DER regimens for breast cancer prevention. We therefore examined markers of DER in the breast, adipose tissue, and serum. Nineteen overweight or obese women at moderately increased risk of breast cancer (lifetime risk, 1 in 6 to 1 in 3) ages between 35 and 45 were randomly allocated to DER [liquid diet, 3,656 kJ/d (864 kcal/d); n = 10] or asked to continue their normal eating patterns (n = 9) for one menstrual cycle. more...

503. Ridaforolimus (MK-8669) synergizes with Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in hormone-sensitive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) represents a key downstream intermediate for a myriad of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option.   Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; “MK-0646”; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; “MK-8669”; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (“LET”, aromatase inhibitor).   Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach.   Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors.

(Submitter supplied) Most breast cancers are luminal, depending on estrogens for growth. The remainder lack estrogen receptors, are hormone-resistant and basal-like. It is thought that breast cancers arise from self-renewing normal stem cells that have undergone malignant transformation. However currently reported cancer stem cells are hormone insensitive and generate basal, rather than luminal tumors. We now describe true luminal hormone-responsive breast cancer stem cells that express estrogen and progesterone receptors. more...

However, recent clinical data suggests that radiation response may vary significantly among subtypes.  Therefore, current practice leads to over- or under-treatment of women whose tumors are more or less radiation responsive.  We hypothesized that this clinical variability may be due, in part, to differences in cellular radiation response. more...

527. Induction of USP17 by combining BET and HDAC inhibitors in breast cancer cells.
(Submitter supplied) Members of bromodomain and extra-C terminal (BET) domain family and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme family efficiently regulate the expression of important oncogenes and tumor suppressors. HDACs induce histone hypoacetylation meanwhile BET proteins bind to acetylated lysines on histones to regulate gene transcription. Here we show that the BET inhibitor JQ1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of both triple negative and estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. more...

528. Ligand-dependent genomic function of glucocorticoid receptor in triple-negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Glucocorticoids (GC) have been widely used as coadjuvants in the treatment of solid tumors, but GC treatment may be associated with poor pharmacotherapeutic response and/or prognosis. The genomic action of GC in these tumors is largely unknown. Here we find that dexamethasone (Dex, a synthetic GC) regulated genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are associated with drug resistance. Importantly, these GC-regulated genes are aberrantly expressed in TNBC patients and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Human and rat umbilical cord matrix mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSC) possess the ability to control the growth of breast carcinoma cells. Comparative analyses of two types of UCMSC suggest that rat UCMSC-dependent growth regulation is significantly stronger than that of human UCMSC. Their different tumoricidal abilities were clarified by analyzing gene expression profiles in the two types of UCMSC. Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression between untreated naïve UCMSC and those co-cultured with species-matched breast carcinoma cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

538. Dynamics of gene expression changes in epithelial and mesenchymal HMLER cell lines transitioning from suspension 3D culture to adhesion cultures
(Submitter supplied) In order to metastasize, few cells need to detach from the primary tumor, and transition through the circulation to distant sites to establish new solid tumor metastases. The gene expression changes occurring between these transitions are poorly understood, and controversial findings have been reported regarding transitions between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) cell states. To model the metastasis process in vitro, here we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes and respective cell fates that are occurring in cells that are transitioning from adhesion culture to suspension 3D culture (mammospheres) and back to adhesion culture in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) Activating mutations of PIK3CA are the most frequent genomic alterations in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors and selective PI3Kα inhibitors are in clinical development. The activity of these agents, however, is not homogenous and only a fraction of patients bearing PIK3CA-mutant ER-positive tumors benefit from single agent administration. Searching for mechanisms of resistance, we observed that suppression of PI3K signaling with different agents results in induction of ER-dependent transcriptional activity as demonstrated by changes in expression in genes containing ER binding sites, enhanced ER transcription and increased occupancy by the ER of promoter regions of upregulated genes. more...

These cell lines differ by a single amino acid substitution (H1047R) caused by single nucleotide change in one allele of the PIK3CA gene which encodes the catalytic subunit p110α of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The H1047R mutation of PIK3CA is one of the most frequently encountered somatic cancer-specific mutations. more...

563. Smad3 ChIP-chip analysis on human breast epithelial cells of the MCF10A series
(Submitter supplied) TGF-betas have complex roles in tumorigenesis, with context-dependent effects that can either suppress or promote tumor progression. Our goal was to use integrated genomic approaches in a model of human breast cancer progression to identify core TGF-beta-regulated genes that specifically reflect the tumor suppressor activity of TGF-beta. The model consisted of the non-tumorigenic MCF10A (“M1”), the premalignant MCF10AT1k.cl2 (“M2”), the early malignant MCF10Ca1h (“M3”) and the highly malignant, metastatic MCF10Ca1a.cl1 (“M4”) cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is mediated by a large multisubunit protein complex. Here we show that RBBP6 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 6), identified initially as an Rb- and p53-binding protein, is a component of this complex and functions in 3' processing in vitro and in vivo. RBBP6 associates with other core factors, and this interaction is mediated by an unusual ubiquitin-like domain, DWNN (domain with no name), that is required for 3' processing activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) The organisation of the mammary epithelial cell hierarchy and how these cells relate to the presentation of human breast tumours is poorly understood. Our results demonstrate that the luminal cell compartment of the mouse mammary gland can be resolved into terminally differentiated oestrogen receptor (ER)+ luminal cells, ER+ luminal progenitors and ER- luminal progenitors. The ER+ luminal progenitors are unique in regards to cell survival, as they are relatively insensitive to loss of oestrogen and progesterone when compared to the other types of mammary epithelial cells. more...

642. Network Biology of Tumor Stem-like Cells Identified a Regulatory Role of CBX5 in Lung Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Mounting evidence points to a link between a cancer possessing stem-like properties and a worse prognosis. To understand the biology, a common approach is to integrate network biology with signal processing mechanics. That said, even with the right tools, predicting the risk for a highly susceptible target using only a handful of gene signatures remains very difficult. By compiling the expression profiles of a panel of tumor stem-like cells (TSLCs) originating in different tissues, comparing these to their parental tumor cells (PTCs) and the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and integrating network analysis with signaling mechanics, we propose that network topologically-weighted signaling processing measurements under tissue-specific conditions can provide scalable and predicable target identification. more...

649. miR-155 regulates the ability of circulating cancer cells to colonize and establish metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Abstract: Metastases are established through a complex multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from the primary tumor and expand at distant sites. Traditionally, studies on metastasis have focused on proteins and protein-coding genes, but recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have achieved increasing interest. miRNAs involved in the metastatic process are poorly defined, and while the use of clinical tissue samples or in vitro assessment for study of the first phases of the metastatic process is not feasible; such processes may be studies using in vivo models created by inoculation of human cell lines into mice. more...

(Submitter supplied) CCN5 is a member of the CCN (Connective Tissue Growth Factor/Cysteine-rich 61/Nephroblastoma overexpressed) family and was identified as an estrogen-inducible gene in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines. However, the role of CCN5 in breast carcinogenesis remains unclear. We report here that CCN5 protein is localized mostly in the cytoplasm, and in part in the nucleus, of human tumor breast tissue. more...

None of the currently available gene signatures correlates to this clinical classification. We aimed to develop a test that is practical for the oncologists, that offers both molecular characterization of BCs, and improved prediction of prognosis and treatment response. more...

701. A DNA Methylation Fingerprint of  1,628 Human Samples
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation is the best characterized of the different layers that make up the epigenetic setting. Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation patterns have been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of human samples and pathological conditions. The recently arrived single-base-resolution technologies for DNA methylation are extremely helpful tools, but are not yet applicable and affordable for studying large groups of subjects. more...

703. Breast Cancer Methylomes Establish an Epigenomic Foundation for Metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Cancer-specific changes in DNA methylation can alter genetic stability, genomic structure, and gene expression.  Promoter CpG island methylation can result in transcriptional silencing and plays an important role in the oncogenic process. We used genome-wide analysis to characterize the methylomes of breast cancers with diverse metastatic behavior.   Here, we describe the identification of novel groups of breast tumors characterized by the presence or absence of coordinate hypermethylation at a large number of genes, demonstrating the existence of a breast-CpG island methylator phenotype (B-CIMP). more...

704. ZNF703 overexpression and/or knockdown in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7
(Submitter supplied) The telomeric amplicon at 8p12 is common in ER+ breast cancers. Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 tumors revealed ZNF703/Zeppo1 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression signature and poor outcome. In the luminal MCF-7 cell line manipulation of ZNF703 expression altered transcription of genes also present within the primary tumor signature, including TGFBR2 (whose promoter was bound by ZNF703). more...

705. Analysis of Promoter Methylation in Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Promoter methylation was assayed in a number of breast cancer and control normal samples along with the effects of 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on breast cancer cell line transcriptomes.  Aberrant promoter hypermethylation is frequently observed in cancer. The potential for this to contribute to tumour development depends on whether the genes affected are repressed because of their methylation. Many aberrantly methylated genes play important roles in development and are bivalently marked in ES cells suggesting that their aberrant methylation may reflect developmental processes. more...

707. Expression of microRNAs and their gene targets are dysregulated in pre-invasive breast cancer (microRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression and may play a causal role in invasive breast cancer. Since many genetic aberrations of invasive disease are detectable in earlier stages, we hypothesized that miRNA expression dysregulation and the predicted changes in gene expression would also be found in early breast neoplasias.   Methods: Expression profiling of 365 miRNAs by RT-qPCR was combined with laser-capture microdissection to obtain an epithelial specific miRNA expression signature of normal breast epithelium (n=9) and of paired samples of histologically normal epithelium (HN) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n=16). more...

To obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of action of WASF3, we have established the stable  WASF3 knockdown  MDA-MB-231 cells using shRNA strategy. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after silencing WASF3 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes associated with breast cancer cell migration and motility

(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy, however resistance is common in ERα-positive tumors that over-express the growth factor receptor ERBB2. Even in the absence of estrogen, ERα can be activated by growth factors including the epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen, however the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown. more...

713. Molecular diversity in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early invasive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive form of breast cancer where cells restricted to the ducts exhibit an atypical phenotype. Some DCIS lesions are believed to rapidly transit to invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), while others remain unchanged. Existing classification systems for DCIS fail to identify those lesions that transit to IDC. We studied gene expression patterns of 31 pure DCIS, 36 pure invasive cancers and 42 cases of mixed diagnosis (invasive cancer with an in situ component) using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays 44k. more...

(Submitter supplied) Prolactin and progesterone act together to regulate mammary alveolar development, and both hormones have been implicated in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here we show that Elf5, a prolactin-induced ETS transcription factor that specifies the mammary secretory cell lineage, is also induced by progestins in breast cancer cells via a direct mechanism. To define the transcriptional response to progestin elicited via Elf5 we made an inducible Elf5 sh-RNA knock down model in T47D breast cancer cells and used it to prevent the progestin-induction of Elf5. more...

733. Time-dependent expressed markers and their characterization for premature senescence induced by ionizing radiation in MCF7
(Submitter supplied) Recently, senescence has been suggested as a defense mechanism to block sporadic induction of cancer cells. Radiation treatment induces proliferating cancer cells to turn into non-proliferating senescent cells in vitro. To characterize transcriptional reprogramming after radiation treatment, we measured the gene expression profiles of MCF7 at different time points after treatment. In these experiments, we found that IR induced premature senescence in MCF7 cells, and IR treatment resulted in significant changes in the expression of 305 marker genes (less than 1% FDR), which were strongly correlated (|r|>0.9) with IR treatment in a time-dependent manner. more...

775. In Vitro and In Vivo Analysis of B-Myb in Basal-Like Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) The basal-like breast cancer subtype portends a poor clinical prognosis, and a defining feature of this subtype is the high expression of genes in the “proliferation signature”.  B-Myb, a member of the MYB protein family of transcription factors, is highly expressed in the proliferation signature and is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of tumor types, including breast.  In this report we demonstrated that B-Myb is highly expressed in basal-like breast cancer relative to the other subtypes, and B-Myb expression alone is prognostic. more...

776. Transcript profiling of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) nodules in Human Patients
(Submitter supplied) Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is characterized by cystic lung destruction caused by smooth, muscle-like LAM cells which have mutations in the tumor suppressor genes Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) 1 or 2, and the capacity to metastasize. Since chemokines and their receptors function in chemotaxis of metastatic cells, we hypothesized that LAM cells may be recruited by chemokine(s) in the lung.  Quantification of 25 chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from LAM patients and healthy volunteers revealed that concentrations of MCP-1/CCL2, GROa/CXCL1 and ENA-78/CXCL5 were significantly higher in samples from LAM patients than healthy volunteers. more...

785. Loss of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor is a common event in Basal-like and Luminal B breast carcinomas
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancers can be classified using whole genome expression into distinct subtypes that show differences in patient prognosis.  One of these groups, the basal-like carcinomas, are poorly differentiated, highly metastatic, and genomically unstable.  These tumors also contain specific genetic alterations with one example being frequent p53 mutations. The loss of the tumor suppressor gene encoded by the retinoblastoma (RB1) locus is a well-characterized occurrence in many tumor types, however, its role in breast cancer is less clear with many reports demonstrating a Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) that does not correlate with loss of RB1 protein expression. more...

812. A comprehensive analysis of copy number variations in the human genome
(Submitter supplied) Segmental copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are associated with developmental disorders and susceptibility to human diseases.  More importantly, these variations may represent a major genetic component of our phenotypic diversity.  In this study, using a whole genome array CGH assay, we identified 3,654 autosomal segmental CNVs, of which 800 appeared at a frequency of at least 3%.  77% of these frequent CNVs are novel. more...

819. A New Breast Tumor Intrinsic Gene List Identifies Novel Characteristics that are Conserved Across Microarray Platforms
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a difficult disease to manage because it is comprised of a spectrum of tumor subtypes with different biological characteristics. Previous gene expression studies using breast tumor “intrinsic” gene lists identified five distinct subtypes of breast tumors: Luminal A, Luminal B, Normal Breast-like, HER2+/ER- and Basal-like. Using a training data set of 102 unique breast tumors, we derive a new “intrinsic” gene list based upon 26 paired samples. more...

820. Hypoxic regulation of gene expression is dominated by the HIF system and can be mimicked by DMOG
(Submitter supplied) The response of cells to hypoxia is characterised by co-ordinated regulation of many genes. Studies of the regulation of the expression of many of these genes by oxygen has implicated a role for the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). The mechanism of oxygen sensing which controls this heterodimeric factor is via oxygen dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by specific 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and FIH-1). more...
